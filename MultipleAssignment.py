# Multiple Assignment
# Python allows us to assign a value to multiple variables in a single statement 
# which is also known as multiple assignment.

# We can apply multiple assignments in two ways either by assigning a single value 
# to multiple variables or assigning multiple values to multiple variables. Lets see given examples.

# 1. Assigning single value to multiple variables

x=y=z=7

print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

# 2.Assigning multiple values to multiple variables:
# The values will be assigned in the order in which variables appears.

a,b,c = 10,15,20
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
