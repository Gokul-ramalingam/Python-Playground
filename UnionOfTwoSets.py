# Union of two Sets
# The union of two sets are calculated by using the or (|) operator. 
# The union of the two sets contains the all the items that are present in both the sets.

# Example 1 : using union | operator
Days1 = {"Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday"}  
Days2 = {"Friday","Saturday","Sunday"}  
print(Days1|Days2) #printing the union of the sets

# Python also provides the union() method which can also be used to calculate the union of two sets.
# Example 2: using union() method
Days1 = {"Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday"}  
Days2 = {"Friday","Saturday","Sunday"}  
print(Days1.union(Days2)) #printing the union of the sets
