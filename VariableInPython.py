# The first character of the variable must be an alphabet or underscore ( _ ).
# All the characters except the first character may be an alphabet of lower-case(a-z), upper-case (A-Z), underscore or digit (0-9).
# Identifier name must not contain any white-space, or special character (!, @, #, %, ^, &, *).
# Identifier name must not be similar to any keyword defined in the language.
# Identifier names are case sensitive for example my name, and MyName is not the same.
# Examples of valid identifiers : a123, _n, n_9, etc.
# Examples of invalid identifiers: 1a, n%4, n 9, etc.

# Declaring Variable and Assigning Values:
# Python does not bound us to declare variable before using in the application. It allows us to create variable at required time.
