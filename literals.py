# Python Literals
# Literals can be defined as a data that is given in a variable or constant.

# Python support the following literals:

# I. String literals:
# String literals can be formed by enclosing a text in the quotes. We can use both single as well as double quotes for a String.

# Eg: "Aman" , '12345'

# Types of Strings:

# There are two types of Strings supported in Python:
# a).Single line String- Strings that are terminated within a single line are known as Single line Strings.

text = 'hello'

# b).Multi line String- A piece of text that is spread along multiple lines is known as Multiple line String.

# There are two ways to create Multiline Strings:

# 1). Adding black slash at the end of each line.

text1 = 'hello\
    Python'

# 2).Using triple quotation marks:-
text2 = '''welcome 
to 
SSSIT'''  

print(text)
print(text1)
print(text2)


# II.Numeric literals:

# Numeric Literals are immutable. Numeric literals can belong to following four different numerical types.
# Int(signed integers)	Long(long integers)	float(floating point)	Complex(complex)

# III. Boolean literals:

# A Boolean literal can have any of the two values: True or False.


# IV. Special literals.

# Python contains one special literal i.e., None.

# None is used to specify to that field that is not created. It is also used for end of lists in Python.

val1 = 10
val2 = None

print(val1)
print(val2)


# V.Literal Collections.

# Collections such as tuples, lists and Dictionary are used in Python.
